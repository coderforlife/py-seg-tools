= Programs =
mrc2xxx: support for x/y trimming
xxx2png: support for blurring
xxx2xxx: support top-bottom flipping

= Future Programs =
png2mha, mha2png, png2png, mha2mha: trivial copy-paste with a few modifications
png2mrc, mha2mrc: need to create an mrc file writer

= Internals =
MRC class:
 * improve, fix, and expand the [] slice usage
 * create MRC writer
 * support "views" which would inteligently read a subvolume
create_labels:
 * support using the same labels across slices
 * support running connected components code on BW data (scipy.ndimage.label)
 * support signed types
Process:
 * figure out why EPD deadlocks
 * figure out why system Python is not doing all commands
 * test PythonProcess and PythonThread
 * speed up initial tree/graph algorithms __get_all_leaves and ancestors
