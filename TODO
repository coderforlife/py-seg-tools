= Programs: =
mrc2xxx: support for x/y trimming
xxx2png: support for blurring

= Future Programs: =
png2mha, mha2png, png2png, mha2mha: trivial copy-paste with a few modifications
png2mrc, mha2mrc: need to create an mrc file writer

= Internals: =
MRC class:
 * improve, fix, and expand the [] slice usage
 * create MRC writer
create_labels:
 * look into using numpy.searchsorted for relabelling [probably much faster if it can be used]
 * support using the same labels across slices
 * improve speed (and actually test speed)
 * support signed types
 * support running connected components code on BW data (scipy.ndimage.label)
Process:
 * figure out why EPD deadlocks
 * figure out why system Python is not doing all commands
 * test PythonProcess and PythonThread
